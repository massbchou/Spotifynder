All Training data must be broken up into the following:
[Entity] [Entity Length] [Tokens] [Tags]

For example the following sentence:
"And on that day, the Lord God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day"

Could be broken up into the following:

["And on that day, the Lord God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day"]
[6]
["And", "on that day,", "the Lord God", "made", "two great lights,", "the greater light to rule the day"]
["conjunction", "prepositional phrase", "subject", "verb", "object", "subject"]

The Entities and their lengths should go in the Entities.txt file with the following format:

Entity tab Entity Length/n (newline) Do not include quotation marks

The Tokens and their tags should go in the TokensTags.txt file with the following format:

Token tab Tag/n (newline) Do not include quotation marks. Note that this means that the TokenTags file will be much longer than the Entities file. 
There is assumed to be a space between EACH token

The following are the possible tags to use for SONG training: 

Song - Ex. "Never Gonna Give You Up"
Artist - Ex. "Rick Astley"
Album - Ex. "Whenever You Need Somebody"
Irrelevant - "banana" or "i liked the song" or "speaker" (anything that is not a song, artist, or album)
Format - Ex. "Sign In" or "Forgot Password?" (Website artefacts)
NoTag - Ex. "And" or "the" or "because" (words that exist to add structure to the sentence)
