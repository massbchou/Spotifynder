It’s a love song, an urban-jungle cry and a perfect anthem of pedal-to-the-metal escape.	13
From a whisper, the sound of an organ builds up like a spiritual beacon being unveiled.	15
Admittedly, it’s hard to dance like no one’s watching when you’re behind the wheel of a Chrysler (or a Fiat Punto, for that matter), but ‘Love Shack’ will liven up any road trip.	24
Tracy Chapman’s beautifully direct 1988 hit, from her eponymous debut album, gives escapism an especially poignant twist.	14
Like Bruce Springsteen’s ‘Born in the U.S.A.,’ ‘Born to Run’ is darker than it may seem {Irrelevant}.	8
The Eagles took flight in 1972 with their debut single: a quick but mellow paean to the romance of the road,{Irrelevant} where a world of troubles— romantic and otherwise— can be shucked at the mere sight of a girl (my lord!) in a flatbed Ford.	29
This R&B standard, written in 1946 by Bobby Troup, has been covered by everyone from the Rolling Stones to John Mayer and Depeche Mode.	15
Billy Joel’s ‘We Didn’t Start the Fire’ taught us more 20th-century American history than a year’s worth of school hisoty lessons.	12
Fiendishly simple with its descending piano chords, ‘Hit the Road Jack’ is sung from the perspective of a philanderer being ejected by his lady.	18
God Only Knows by the Beach Boys. I believe Paul McCartney even considers it the greatest song ever.	10
Frank Sinatra thought Harrison's "Something" was the perfect love song.	7
Every time I listen to it, I am immediately calmed down and have no worries. My posture immediately changes and I slump down.	14
Alice Kristiansen’s cover if it is amazing. Just as good as the original. I highly recommend you to listen to it.	11
I always cried when I heard it as a kid. Decided I never wanted to be an astronaut	12
I’ve loved this song since my early teens. Now that I’m in my mid-thirties, I still love it but it just continues to make me more emotional {Irrelevant}. Such a beautiful so no.	22

Spotify Excellent taste in music. It's funny, I'm the only one of my friends who loves bands like Pink Floyd and Sigur Ros as well as Alexisonfire (my friends are divided between the two types of genres).	28
You happened to pick my favorite Queen song too and Clint Eastwood is my "make me feel happy / energize me" song.	19

The orphan Alexander Hamilton experiences a hard early life, and through his smarts and the charitability of the townsfolks leaves his home, the island of Nevis ("Alexander Hamilton").	24
As a student at King's College in New York in 1776, Hamilton meets Aaron Burr, John Laurens, the Marquis de Lafayette, and Hercules Mulligan ("Aaron Burr, Sir"), and impresses them with his rhetorical skills ("My Shot").	25
The latter three and Hamilton affirm their revolutionary goals to each other, while Burr remains apprehensive ("The Story of Tonight").	16
Later, the daughters of the wealthy Philip Schuyler — Peggy, Angelica, and Eliza —go into town and share their opinion on the upcoming revolution ("The Schuyler Sisters");	22
it is at this time that Samuel Seabury warns everyone about the dangers of Congress while Hamilton disagrees and counters Seabury ("Farmer Refuted"), until King George III insists on his authority ("You'll Be Back").	25
During the New York and New Jersey campaign, Hamilton accepts a position as George Washington's aide-de-camp despite longing for field command ("Right Hand Man").	17
At a ball hosted by Philip Schuyler ("A Winter's Ball"), Eliza falls helplessly in love with Hamilton, who reciprocates her feelings to the point of marriage ("Helpless"), as Angelica suppresses her own feelings for the sake of their happiness ("Satisfied").	29
After the wedding, Burr and Hamilton congratulate each other's successes ("The Story of Tonight (Reprise)") while Burr reflects on Hamilton's swift rise while considering his own more cautious career as well as his affair with Theodosia, the wife of a British officer ("Wait For It").	31
By far the most well known Christian ballad that's come out of the industry in the last 15 years and staying at number 1 on the Billboard's Hot Christian Songs for over two years, Lauren Daigle's "You Say" has not only touched the hearts of thousands but has provided those in need of a powerful message a sense of identity and strength to move forward.	48
In this live performance of "Holy Water" by We The Kingdom, the audience powerfully sings along with the rock-filled energy and acoustic simplicity of this powerful gospel song.	19
It's 12 minutes of pure emotion!	5
The live recording of "The Blessing" begins with a slow intro as Cody Carnes leads the audience in prayer.	15
Keeping the audience engaged, the song steadily climbs both in vocals from Kari Jobe and instrumentals from Elevation Worship bursting into a rich and powerful performance that will certainly have you either in tears or wil {NoTag}l leave your heart fluttering with a sense of salvation.	34
Kanye West is extra in his 9th studio album release of "Follow God."	8
"Rescue Story" was the album's second single release quickly rising to the top of the charts and certifying the album as Gold with over 500,000 sales.	20
Reaching number three on the US Hot Christians Songs chart after its January 24, 2020 release, Cory Asbury's "The Father's House" is the lead single on his third studio album "To Love a Fool."	17
As conditions worsen for the Continental Army ("Stay Alive"), Hamilton aids Laurens in a duel against Charles Lee, who had insulted Washington ("Ten Duel Commandments"). Laurens injures Lee, who yields, while Hamilton is temporarily suspended by Washington over the duel and is sent home ("Meet Me Inside"). There, Eliza reveals that she is pregnant with her first child, Philip, and asks Hamilton to slow down to take in what has happened in their lives ("That Would Be Enough"). After Lafayette persuades France to get involved on the colonists' side, he urges Washington to call Hamilton back to help plan the final Battle of Yorktown. Washington agrees ("Guns and Ships"), but explains to Hamilton, who is convinced that he should die a martyr and a hero in war, that he should be wary of what he does next because whatever he does will be known for all time ("History Has Its Eyes on You"). At the Battle of Yorktown, Hamilton meets up with Lafayette to take down the British, revealing that Mulligan was recruited as a spy, helping them figure out how to trap the British and win the war ("Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)").	0
Soon after the victory of Yorktown, King George asks the newborn America how it will succeed on its own ("What Comes Next?"), while Lafayette returns to France with plans to inspire his people to have their own revolution. Hamilton's son Philip is born, while Burr has a daughter, Theodosia, and the two tell their children how they will do anything to protect them ("Dear Theodosia"). Hamilton receives word that his long-time friend John Laurens has been killed in a seemingly pointless battle after the war was won and throws himself into his work ("The Laurens Interlude/Tomorrow There'll Be More Of Us"). He co-authors The Federalist Papers and is selected as Secretary of the Treasury by newly elected President Washington, amidst Eliza begging Hamilton to stay and Angelica moving to London with her new husband ("Non-Stop").	0
